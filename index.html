              <h2>John's Journey: How <span>Private</span> Money Transformed His Business</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Meet John, a small business owner with big dreams. For years, John struggled to secure funding from
              traditional lenders. Despite his determination and promising business plan, he faced countless rejections
              due to his less-than-perfect credit score and limited financial history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feeling discouraged, John was on the verge of giving up. That's when he discovered PINK Capital Privet
              Money Lending.
            </p>
            <p>
              With PINK Capital, John experienced people not "Red Tape". The application process was straightforward,
              without the burdensome paperwork and stringent requirements he had encountered before. Moreover, PINK
              Capital focused on the value of his collateral and the potential of his business, rather than dwelling on
              his credit score.
            </p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <div>
            <p>
              Within a short period, John received the funding he desperately needed. It was a turning point for his
              business. With the financial support from PINK Capital, John was able to expand his operations, hire
              additional staff, and secure new contracts. His dreams were no longer limited by the rigid boundaries
              imposed by traditional lenders.
            </p>
            <p>
              John's story is just one example of how private money lending can transform lives and businesses. If
              you've
              faced similar challenges, we understand your journey.

                  Collateral by definition is something pledged as security for repayment of a loan, to be forfeited in
                  the event of a default. For us this is the security we need to fund you lending request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, collateral can be many things. Typically it is real estate with equity or maybe free and
                  clear property, but it could be cars, boats, trucks, heavy equipment, really anything with value and
                  equity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remember, the more in depth about your collateral you are, the quicker we can approve your loan. So
                  when it comes to the collateral section of our application, please take you time and fill in the
                  details.
